1. The console output will be 2 because there are no errors.  
2. The console output will be 150 because there are no errors.  
3. The console output will be 150 because there are no errors.  
4. It returns this array: `[50, 100, 150]` because there are no errors.  
5. Error because i is not able to be accessed outside the loop due to it being defined with "let".    
6. Error because dicountedPrice was only defined within the code block above due to "let".  
7. The console output will be 150 because it was defined outside the code block so it can be reassigned within the block.  
8. It returns this array: `[50, 100, 150]` because any variables defined with "let" are defined outside the for loop code block, so the function works.  
9. Error because i is not able to be accessed outside the loop due to it being defined with "let".  
10. The console output will be 3 because the const length was defined as that originally and const cannot be reassigned.  
11.  It returns this array: `[50, 100, 150]` because the const variables are not being reassigned.
12.  A) `student.name`. B) `student['Grad Year']`. C) `student.greeting()`. D) `student['Favorite Teacher'].name`. E) `student.courseLoad[0]`.  
13. A) `'32'` since '3' is a string, so adding 2 concatenates the string. B) `1` because '3' is converted to a number and then 2 is subtracted. C) `3` because `null` is treated as a 0. D) `'3null'` because '3' is a string, so adding another string causes concatenation, and `null` is treated as a string here. E) `4` because `true` is treated as 1 and added to 3. F) `0` because both `false` and `null` are treated as 0s and added together. G) `'3undefined'` because '3' is a string, so adding another string causes concatenation, and `undefined` is treated as a string here. H) `NaN` (Not a Number) because subtraction between a string and `undefined` is not allowed.  
14. A) `true` because when strings are compared to numbers with `>` , it converts the string to a number, and '2' (as a number) is greater than 1. B) `true` because it first compares '2' and '1' and '2' comes after '1' in the Unicode table. C) `true` because `==` converts the operands to the same type before it compares, so 2 and '2' will have the same value. D) `false` because `===` compares the values and types of the operands but requires both to be the same to return `true`, which in this case they are not. E) `false` because `true` is converted to become 1, which does not equal 2. F) `true` because Boolean(2) evaluates to `true`, so the values are the same type and value.  
15. The `==` operator tries to make operands equal by converting them to the same type, while the `===` operator compares the values and types of the operands but requires both to be the same to return `true`.
17. The result will be `[2, 4, 6]` because in the for loop, each element of the array `[1, 2, 3]` is passed through the doSomething function, which multiplies each element by 2, and then pushed to the result array.
